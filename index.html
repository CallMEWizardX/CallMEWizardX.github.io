    <h1>About Rax Lapis (Zhongli)</h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size: 20px;">Primarily, Zhongli is geared to be a great Support. Starting from his shield, it seems to have great durability and duration, which not only make it a great defensive tool but also make it synergize perfectly with the Retracing Bolide set, as stated earlier. Another key part of Zhongliâ€™s Supportive toolkit is his Elemental Burst, which petrifies opponents for 4 seconds at Talent lv 10. Now, while the fact that Zhongli doesn't have access to mind-boggling damage multipliers such as Vaporize or Melt, if built well his Burst will consistently inflict high Damage, but don't expect him to outdamage characters that benefit from overpowered Elemental Reactions. The petrify effect isn't particularly incredible, but it's a nice tool to block opponents like Fatui before they use their shields. So, what makes Zhongli good? What could he bring to your Abyss Team, for example? His shield, in particular, is a consistently great defensive tool thanks to its low CD and relatively high Damage absorption capabilities - in realistic scenarios you should expect it to absorb 6000-8000 Damage.</p>
